		"description": "The signature is identical to `useEffect`, but it fires synchronously before all DOM mutations. Use this to inject styles into the DOM before reading layout in `useLayoutEffect`. Since this hook is limited in scope, this hook does not have access to refs and cannot schedule updates.\n`useInsertionEffect` should be limited to css-in-js library authors. Prefer `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` instead."
